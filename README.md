# raycast-engine-ARM
A ray-casting engine for the Altera DE1-SoC, targeting the on-board ARM-based HPS. Contains a simple maze the player can walk through, as a proof of concept.

### Currently in the works:
- Texture-scaling algorithm
- Shading of walls based on distance from player
- Drawing a ceiling, floor and adding cubemaps
- Fixing wall distortion around 90° and 270°
